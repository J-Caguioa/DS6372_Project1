## Introduction

The Microsoft Data Science Capstone dataset was made available on Kaggle in July 2018. Using socioeconomic information aggregated by the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, the objective is to predict U.S. heart disease mortality (per 100,000 people) at the county level. Considering that heart disease remains the leading global cause of death, investigating risk factors is vital in developing a comprehensive treatment strategy.

## Data Description

The data that we are currently working with is called the....

```{r}
# Load two files, Training_values and Training_labels, as data.frames.
dfValues <- read.csv(file='microsoft-data-science-capstone/Training_values.csv', header=T, sep=",")
dfLabels <- read.csv(file='microsoft-data-science-capstone/Training_labels.csv', header=T, sep=",")

# Add response variable to left side of Training_values and shorten name.
dfFull <- cbind(dfLabels$heart_disease_mortality_per_100k, dfValues)
names(dfFull)[names(dfFull) == 'dfLabels$heart_disease_mortality_per_100k'] <- 'heart_disease_mortality_per_100k'

# Remove row_id.
dfFull <- subset(dfFull, select=-row_id)
```

```{r}
# Optional shorten column names by removing *__ category descriptors.
# names(dfFull) = sub("area__|econ__|demo__|health__", "", names(dfFull))
str(dfFull)
```

* Note that demo__pct_male can be derived as 1 - demo__pct_female.
* Adding all 5 demo__pct_[race] columns produces number between .990 and 1.000, as expected. Race proportions explicitly provided.
* Adding all 4 demo__pct_[education] columns produces number between .990 and 1.000, as expected. Education proportions explicitly provided.
* This dataset is already presplit from a test set. It is unclear whether the available data points are considered repeated measures based on year, as there is no way to identify individual counties.

# Quick exploratory histograms of any numeric variables.
dfFull %>%
  keep(is.numeric) %>%
  gather() %>%
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
    facet_wrap(~ key, scales="free") +
    geom_histogram() +
    theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=4, angle=45, vjust=1, hjust=1),
          axis.text.y=element_text(size=6),
          strip.text=element_text(size=4, margin=margin()))

```

```{r edaScatterplots}
# Heart disease mortality with factors.
pairs(dfFull[,c(1,2,3,34)])
# Heart disease mortality with employment, insurance, gender, and age variables.
pairs(dfFull[,c(1,5:11)])
# Heart disease mortality with race and birth/death rates.
pairs(dfFull[,c(1,12:16,21:22)])
# Heart disease mortality with education variables.
pairs(dfFull[,c(1,17:20)])
# Heart disease mortality with other health variables.
pairs(dfFull[,c(1,23:28)])
pairs(dfFull[,c(1,29:33)])
```

* Some collinearity shown between race variables because they are proportions.
* Maybe air_pollution_particulate_matter should be redefined as factor.

```{r edaCorrplot}
# Correlation plot only takes numeric data. Remove factor variables.
dfNumeric <- dfFull %>% keep(is.numeric)

# Correlation plot on numeric variables. pairwise.complete.obs ignoring any pairs with NA.
corrplot(cor(dfNumeric, use="pairwise.complete.obs"), type = "upper", tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45, tl.cex = 0.5, number.cex = 0.3, number.digits=2, method="color", addCoef.col="white")
```

```{r edaVif}
# VIF function from car library.
fullModel <- lm(heart_disease_mortality_per_100k~., data=dfFull, singular.ok=T)
vif(fullModel)[,3]^2
```

An initial attempt at obtaining VIFs results in an error on aliased coefficients, indicating that some variables are likely linearly dependent.

```{r edaVif2}
# Check attributes with aliased coefficients.
ld.vars <- attributes(alias(fullModel)$Complete)$dimnames[[1]]
ld.vars
```

According to alias(), a few levels of area__urban_influence and the variable demo__pct_adults_bachelors_or_higher show linear dependence. After dropping these two, VIFs can be obtained from the full model.

```{r edaVif3}
# Remove linearly dependent variables.
drop <- c('demo__pct_adults_bachelors_or_higher', 
          'area__urban_influence')
dfPartial <- dfFull[, !(names(dfFull) %in% drop)]

# Build full model with remaining 33 predictors and check VIFs.
fullModel <- lm(heart_disease_mortality_per_100k~., data=dfPartial)
vif(fullModel)[,3]
```

Most of the demographic variables pertaining to race return VIFs greater than 5, namely for non-Hispanic whites (15.70), non-Hispanic African Americans (12.77), Hispanics (10.40), and American Indian or Alaskan Natives (5.81). In each row racial proportions add up to ~1, so it makes sense that these variables are collinear (for example, minority groups generally stay underrepresented in each county). Previous statistics show that mortality rates differ by race, which suggests that including it could add predictive power. However in order to proceed with a reliable model, other factors often correlated with race can remain in its stead.

```{r edaVif4}
# Remove all race-related variables from dataset.
drop2 <- c('demo__pct_hispanic', 
          'demo__pct_non_hispanic_african_american', 
          'demo__pct_non_hispanic_white', 
          'demo__pct_american_indian_or_alaskan_native', 
          'demo__pct_asian')
dfPartial2 <- dfPartial[, !(names(dfPartial) %in% drop2)]

# Build full model with remaining 26 predictors and check VIFs.
fullModel2 <- lm(heart_disease_mortality_per_100k~., data=dfPartial2)
vif(fullModel2)[,3]
```

```{r edaVif5}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(fullModel)
summary(fullModel)
```

## Introduction

The Microsoft Data Science Capstone dataset was made available on Kaggle in July 2018 (https://www.kaggle.com/nandvard/microsoft-data-science-capstone). Using socioeconomic information aggregated by the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, the objective is to predict U.S. heart disease mortality (per 100,000 people) at the county level. Considering that heart disease remains the leading global cause of death, investigating risk factors is vital in developing a comprehensive treatment strategy.


## Data Description

For this project, we are working with the microsoft data science capstone data. Within this data set, there are 33 variables, 3 categorical variables, and 30 continuous variables. The categroical variables are: area__rucc, area__urban__influence, and econ__economic_typology. The area__rucc variable which is the Rural-Urban Continuum codes, forming a classification scheme that distinguishes metropolitan counties by degree of urbanization and adjacentty to a metro area. These counties are in the U.S. are assigned one of 9 codes, which can be found from the USDA Economic Research Service, https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes/. The area__urban__influence variable represents the urban influence codes. The codes form a classificantion scheme that distinguishes metropolitan counties by means of population size of their metro area, and nonmetropolitan counties by size of the largest city or town and promixity to metro and micropolitan areas. These codes can be found from the USDA Economic Research Service, https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/urban-influence-codes/. Last, the econ__economic_typology variable is known as the county typology codes. These codes classify U.S. counties according to six mutulally exclusive categories of economic dependence and six overlapping categories of policy-relevant themes.These codes can be found at USDA Economic Research Service, https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-typology-codes.aspx. From the continuous variables there are split into different sections, economic: econ__pct_civilian_labor, econ__pct_unemployment, econ__pct_uninsured_adults, econ__pct_uninsured_children, demographics: demo__pct_female, demo__pct_below_18_years_of_age, demo__pct_aged_65_years_and_older, demo__pct_hispanic, demo__pct_non_hispanic_african_american, demo__pct_non_hispanic_white, demo__pct_american_indian_or_alaskan_native, demo__pct_asian, demo__pct_adults_less_than_a_high_school_diploma, demo__pct_adults_with_high_school_diploma, demo__pct_adults_with_some_college, demo__pct_adults_bachelors_or_higher, demo__birth_rate_per_1k, demo__death_rate_per_1k, health: health__pct_adult_obesity, health__pct_adult_smoking, health__pct_diabetes, health__pct_low_birthweight, health__pct_excessive_drinking, health__pct_physical_inacticity, health__air_pollution_particulate_matter, health__homicides_per_100k, health__motor_vehicle_crash_deaths_per_100k, health__pop_per_dentist, health__pop_per_primary_care_physician, and the year which is split into year a and year b.


```{r}
# Load two files, Training_values and Training_labels, as data.frames.

dfLabels <- read.csv(file='microsoft-data-science-capstone/Training_labels.csv', header=T, sep=",")

# Add response variable to left side of Training_values and shorten name.

```

```{r}
# Optional shorten column names by removing *__ category descriptors.
names(dfFull) = sub("area__|econ__|demo__|health__", "", names(dfFull))

```

* Note that demo__pct_male can be derived as 1 - demo__pct_female.
* Adding all 5 demo__pct_[race] columns produces number between .990 and 1.000, as expected. Race proportions explicitly provided.
* Adding all 4 demo__pct_[education] columns produces number between .990 and 1.000, as expected. Education proportions explicitly provided.
* This dataset is already presplit from a test set. It is unclear whether the available data points are considered repeated measures based on year, as there is no way to identify individual counties.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r missingValues}
colSums(is.na(dfFull))
```

For the exploratory data analysis portion of this project, tools such as histograms, heatmaps, and variance of inflation factors will be used. During the exploratory data analysis phase, the distribution of our continuous variables will be address, as well as multicolinearity. Multicolinearity is when there is a presence of very high inter-associations among the explanatory variables(possible predictors). A common occurance of multilinearity can be detected when variables are highly correlated to one another.  The reason why it is important to address the problem of multicolinearity is because if there are high inter-associations among the explanatory vairables, then an statistical inferences made from the data may not be reliable. 

```{r edaHistograms}
# Quick exploratory histograms of any numeric variables.
dfFull %>%
  keep(is.numeric) %>%
  gather() %>%
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
    facet_wrap(~ key, scales="free") +
    geom_histogram() +
    theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=4, angle=45, vjust=1, hjust=1),
          axis.text.y=element_text(size=6),
          strip.text=element_text(size=4, margin=margin()))

# Quick exploratory histograms of any factors.
dfFull %>%
  keep(is.factor) %>%
  gather() %>%
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
    facet_wrap(~ key, scales="free") +
    geom_bar() +
    theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=3, angle=45, vjust=1, hjust=1),
          axis.text.y=element_text(size=6),
          strip.text=element_text(size=4, margin=margin()))
```
* I think we should drop the scatterplots and just work with the heatmap and the vif to address multicolinearity. I think that we should do the scatterplots after removing any factors with a high vif, and then doing our model selection.
```{r edaScatterplots}
# Heart disease mortality with factors.
pairs(dfFull[,c(1,2,3,34)])
# Heart disease mortality with employment, insurance, gender, and age variables.
pairs(dfFull[,c(1,5:11)])
# Heart disease mortality with race and birth/death rates.
pairs(dfFull[,c(1,12:16,21:22)])
# Heart disease mortality with education variables.
pairs(dfFull[,c(1,17:20)])
# Heart disease mortality with other health variables.
pairs(dfFull[,c(1,23:28)])
pairs(dfFull[,c(1,29:33)])
```

* Some collinearity shown between race variables because they are proportions.
* Maybe air_pollution_particulate_matter should be redefined as factor.

```{r edaCorrplot(before)}
# Correlation plot only takes numeric data. Remove factor variables.
dfNumeric <- dfFull %>% keep(is.numeric)

# Correlation plot on numeric variables. pairwise.complete.obs ignoring any pairs with NA.
corrplot(cor(dfNumeric, use="pairwise.complete.obs"), type = "upper", tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45, tl.cex = 0.5, number.cex = 0.3, number.digits=2, method="color", addCoef.col="white")
```

```{r edaVif, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# VIF function from car library
fullModel <- lm(heart_disease_mortality_per_100k~., data=dfFull, singular.ok=T)
vif(fullModel)[,3]^2
```

An initial attempt at obtaining VIFs results in an error on aliased coefficients, indicating that some variables are likely linearly dependent.

```{r edaVif2}
fullModel <- lm(heart_disease_mortality_per_100k~., data=dfFull, singular.ok=T)
=======
# Check attributes with aliased coefficients.
ld.vars <- attributes(alias(fullModel)$Complete)$dimnames[[1]]
ld.vars
```

According to alias(), a few levels of area__urban_influence and the variable demo__pct_adults_bachelors_or_higher show linear dependence. After dropping these two, VIFs can be obtained from the full model.

```{r edaVif3}
#removing the two variables that show linear dependence
drop <- c('demo__pct_adults_bachelors_or_higher',
          'area__urban_influence')
dfPartial <- dfFull[, !(names(dfFull) %in% drop)]
```

```{r edaheatmap(after)}
#using heatmap visual to see which variables have multicolinarity
# Correlation plot only takes numeric data. Remove factor variables.
dfNumeric2 <- dfPartial %>% keep(is.numeric)

# Correlation plot on numeric variables. pairwise.complete.obs ignoring any pairs with NA.
corrplot(cor(dfNumeric2, use="pairwise.complete.obs"), type = "upper", tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45, tl.cex = 0.5, number.cex = 0.3, number.digits=2, method="color", addCoef.col="white")

```

```{r}
#running vif
=======
# Remove linearly dependent variables.
drop <- c('demo__pct_adults_bachelors_or_higher',
          'area__urban_influence')
dfPartial <- dfFull[, !(names(dfFull) %in% drop)]

# Build full model with remaining 33 predictors and check VIFs.

fullModel <- lm(heart_disease_mortality_per_100k~., data=dfPartial)
vif(fullModel)[,3]
```

After finding what variables show linear dependence using the alias() function, we removed those variables from our data and proceed to using, the vif function from the car package. When using vif to address colinearity within the data,  the rule of thumb is when a variable has a vif greater than 10, that variable can beremoved from data.Keeping this rul of thumb in mind,  we find two variables that we can remove from our model: demo__pct_non_hispanic_african_american (vif=12.77), and demo__pct_non_hispanic_white (vif=15.70). 

Most of the demographic variables pertaining to race return VIFs greater than 5, namely for non-Hispanic whites (15.70), non-Hispanic African Americans (12.77), Hispanics (10.40), and American Indian or Alaskan Natives (5.81). In each row racial proportions add up to ~1, so it makes sense that these variables are collinear (for example, minority groups generally stay underrepresented in each county). Previous statistics show that mortality rates differ by race, which suggests that including it could add predictive power. However in order to proceed with a reliable model, other factors often correlated with race can remain in its stead.

```{r edaVif4}
# Remove all race-related variables from dataset.
drop2 <- c('demo__pct_hispanic',
          'demo__pct_non_hispanic_african_american',
          'demo__pct_non_hispanic_white',
          'demo__pct_american_indian_or_alaskan_native',
          'demo__pct_asian')
dfPartial2 <- dfPartial[, !(names(dfPartial) %in% drop2)]

# Build full model with remaining 26 predictors and check VIFs.
fullModel2 <- lm(heart_disease_mortality_per_100k~., data=dfPartial2)
vif(fullModel2)[,3]
```

```{r edaVif5}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(fullModel)
summary(fullModel)
```


```{r}
#removing demo__pct_non_hispanic_african_american & demo__pct_non_hispanic_white
drop <- c('demo__pct_non_hispanic_african_american',
          'demo__pct_non_hispanic_white','demo__pct_adults_bachelors_or_higher',
          'area__urban_influence')
dfPartial2 <- dfFull[, !(names(dfFull) %in% drop)]

```

```{r}
#rerunning vif after removing demo__pct_non_hispanic_african_american & demo__pct_non_hispanic_white
fullModel2 <- lm(heart_disease_mortality_per_100k~., data=dfPartial2)
vif(fullModel2)[,3]

```

After dropping a total of four variables: 'demo__pct_non_hispanic_african_american',  'demo__pct_non_hispanic_white','demo__pct_adults_bachelors_or_higher', and 
'area__urban_influence' the vif factors of the remaining variables are less than 10. We are now ready to proceed with the regression analysis portion of this project.

# Secondary Analysis

The full dataset contains information for U.S. counties across two undisclosed years, a and b. However, because the counties themselves are unidentified, it is unclear whether each county is represented by more than one year in the provided training data. (For example, does County X have rows for both Year A and Year B in the original training set? Or is Year A in the training file and Year B in the test file?) Additionally, the span of time between the two years could affect whether one could argue that independence exists between data points. (Across counties, mortality rates may be more similar between 2015 and 2016 than between 2000 and 2016.) In short, true time independence within the data is suspect. 

One could even make a case against spatial independence due to regional elements that might affect known heart disease risk factors, such as statewide smoking regulations or food deserts, but it is assumed that the county classification schema captures these nuances.

Independence is assumed in order to run further analysis. Because each county only has two data points at maximum and it is not possible to match them together, a time series or repeated measures analysis cannot be easily performed. The presence of several factor variables makes a two-way ANOVA the logical next step.

## 2-Way ANOVA: Introduction

As discussed in the earlier EDA, the dataset comes with four factors:

* 'rucc': Rural-Urban Continuum Codes, which classify counties into three metropolitan categories (by population size) and six nonmetropolitan categories (by urbanization and metro area adjacency).
* 'urban_influence': Urban Influence Codes, which classify counties into two metropolitan categories (by population size) and ten nonmetropolitan categories (by largest town size and metro/micro adjacency).
* 'economic_typology': County Typology Codes, which classify counties into "six mutually exclusive categories of economic dependence."
* 'yr': Indicates data from Year A or Year B.

Of these, the metro/nonmetro divide and economic systems are the most easily understood, so they are selected for analysis. One could reason that variables underlying an area's population size or specialized economic product would have some effect on heart disease mortality. Conducting a two-way ANOVA will show whether these predictors have some interaction effect on the response; in other words, does a discernible simultaneous effect different from the sum of their parts exist?

## Main Analysis Content

For simplicity, RUCC is recoded based on metropolitan and nonmetropolitan categorization without accounting for population size subcategories or (in the case of nonmetro counties) metro adjacency. Later on the number of potential combinations between pairs of levels increases exponentially with each additional level, so it is helpful to reduce RUCC from nine levels to two at this step.

```{r recode}
# Create simplified version of rucc on two levels: metro and nonmetro. Default alphabetical levels of RUCC are set with first 3 as metro and last 6 as nonmetro.
levels(dfFull$rucc)
dfFull <- mutate(dfFull, simple_rucc = ifelse(rucc %in% rucc[c(1,2,3)], "metro", "nonmetro"))
dfFull$simple_rucc <- as.factor(dfFull$simple_rucc)
levels(dfFull$simple_rucc)

# Remove "-dependent" clause from economic typology levels for cleaner HSD table output later due to "A:B-A:B" formatting.
levels(dfFull$economic_typology) <- sub("-dependent", "", levels(dfFull$economic_typology))
levels(dfFull$economic_typology)
```

Two-way ANOVA has three main assumptions: normality, equality of variance, and independence. The third has already been discussed, so the remaining two are addressed with the following plots.

```{r summaryTable}
# Function for various summary statistics used to create mean profile plot. All following code in this chunk borrowed from Turner's HW3.
summarystats <- function(x) {
  result <- c(length(x), mean(x), sd(x), sd(x)/length(x), min(x), max(x), IQR(x))
  names(result) <- c("N", "Mean", "SD", "SE", "min", "max", "IQR")
  return(result)
}

# Expected table has 2*6 = 12 (simple_rucc * economic_typology) combined levels.
sumstatsRuccEcon <- aggregate(heart_disease_mortality_per_100k ~ simple_rucc*economic_typology, data=dfFull, summarystats)
sumstatsRuccEcon <- cbind(sumstatsRuccEcon[,1:2], sumstatsRuccEcon[,-(1:2)])
sumstatsRuccEcon
```

```{r meanProfilePlot}
# Mean profile plot for Simplified RUCC and Economic Typology. Code borrowed from Turner's HW3.
png("meanProfilePlot.png", width = 500, height = 350)
ggplot(sumstatsRuccEcon, aes(x = economic_typology, y = Mean, group = simple_rucc, color = simple_rucc)) +
  xlab("Economic Typology") +
  ylab("County-Level Heart Disease Mortality (per 100k)") +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual("Simple RUCC", values=c("darkorange", "darkgreen")) +
  ggtitle("Mean Profile Plot, SD Error Bars") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Mean-SD, ymax = Mean+SD), width = .1) +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = 9),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 6),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
dev.off()
```

The sizes of the metro and nonmetro standard deviation error bars are relatively similar across all levels of economic typology; there is no significant visual evidence against constant variance.

```{r anovaFit}
# Full nonadditive 2-way model between simple RUCC and economic typology on heart disease mortality. All following code in this chunk borrowed from Turner's HW3.
modelRuccEconNonadd <- aov(heart_disease_mortality_per_100k ~ simple_rucc + economic_typology + simple_rucc:economic_typology, data = dfFull)

# Extract fitted values and residuals for easier access.
fitModelRuccEconNonadd <- data.frame(fitted.values = modelRuccEconNonadd$fitted.values, residuals = modelRuccEconNonadd$residuals)

# Residual vs fitted plot.
plot1 <- ggplot(fitModelRuccEconNonadd, aes(x = fitted.values, y = residuals)) +
  xlab("Predicted") +
  ylab("Residuals") +
  geom_point()

# QQ residual plot.
plot2 <- ggplot(fitModelRuccEconNonadd, aes(sample = residuals)) +
  stat_qq() +
  geom_abline(intercept = mean(fitModelRuccEconNonadd$residuals), slope = sd(fitModelRuccEconNonadd$residuals))

# Histogram of residuals.
plot3 <- ggplot(fitModelRuccEconNonadd, aes(x = residuals)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 20, color = "black", fill = "gray") +
  geom_density(alpha = .1, fill = "red")

# Display residual diagnostics.
png("residualDiagnostics.png", width = 500, height = 350)
grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, ncol=3)
dev.off()
```

The residuals in the Q-Q plot generally fall along the diagonal with some deviation at the edges. The residual histogram shows minor left skew based on the x-axis.

```{r diagnostic}
# Obtain R's default diagnostic plots.
png("residualDefaultPlots.png", width = 350, height = 350)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(modelRuccEconNonadd)
dev.off()
```

The residuals and standardized residuals are generally clustered in a cloud. From all these plots, there is not significant evidence against normality. Furthermore, there are no major outliers.

In summary, all assumptions are met. Next, does an interaction effect exist? If so, the interaction between simplified RUCC and economic typology will be looked at more closely. If not, the main effects will be studied instead.

```{r type3}
# Type 3 SS F-table.
car::Anova(modelRuccEconNonadd, type=3)
```

The type-III sum of squares F table shows that economic typology is significant as a main effect (p-value 2.459e-06). But more interestingly, the interaction between simplified RUCC and economic typology is also significant (p-value 1.117e-06). Considering these predictors alone, heart disease mortality rate will change for one based on the level of the other.

```{r}
# Full TukeyHSD call with all 66 combinations.
fullTukey <- TukeyHSD(modelRuccEconNonadd, "simple_rucc:economic_typology", conf.level = 0.95)
fullTukey <- as.data.frame(fullTukey$`simple_rucc:economic_typology`)
fullTukey

# Use adjusted p-value as filter to retrieve rows where p adj is below familywise error rate of 0.05.
sigTukey <- TukeyHSD(modelRuccEconNonadd, "simple_rucc:economic_typology", conf.level = 0.95)
sigTukey <- sigTukey$`simple_rucc:economic_typology`
sigTukey <- as.data.frame(sigTukey)
padj <- sigTukey$`p adj`
sigTukey <- sigTukey[padj < 0.05, ]
sigTukey

fullTukey <- fullTukey[order(fullTukey$`p adj`), ]
fullTukey
```

Of all 66 possible two-point combinations (reference the 12 points in the earlier mean profile plot), 39 pairs return a significant difference in mean heart disease mortality rates. In other words, 59% of the pairwise intersections of levels in RUCC and economic typology have significantly different means.

Around what value does the difference between means in mortality rates start becoming significant? Sorting the full list of confidence intervals by Tukey-adjusted p-values helps paint the picture, but it is not a clear-cut answer. For example, an absolute value difference of 17.13 (nonmetro:Recreation-nonmetro:Farm, adj p-value 5.12e-03) is significant but a difference of 27.91 (metro:Mining-nonmetro:Farm, adj p-value 1.60e-01) is not. This particular instance could partly be explained by the comparatively smaller sample size of metro:Mining, shown in the summary statistics table, resulting in a wider confidence interval. In general larger differences in means, especially 20 deaths per 100k and above, are more likely to be significant.

```{r tukeyPlot}

```

## 2-Way ANOVA: Conclusion

While plotting all 66 TukeyHSD pairwise confidence intervals demonstrates exactly which intersections of levels differ, the means profile plot used in the equality of variance assumption earlier provides an intuitive macroscopic view of understanding the data. 

For example, the nonmetropolitan heart disease mortality rate is generally higher than for metropolitan counties except in farm-dependent economic systems, an epitome of the predictor interaction. (Although the difference in means between metro and nonmetro farming is not statistically significant at p-value 9.72e-01, the trend itself is interesting to note). Why might this be? Perhaps socioeconomic factors generally associated with nonmetropolitan areas, such as lower access to healthcare, are trumped by the nonsedentary lifestyle of farm life. Mining could be considered comparably active, and yet mining nonmetropolitan counties have among the highest mortality rates. Maybe pollution associated with the work overrides any potential health benefits. Some of these socioeconomic factors are captured elsewhere in the full dataset, so verifying whether such correlations actually exist could be helpful in logically explaining the 2-way ANOVA results when considering RUCC and economic typology as the only predictors.

Another interesting example is recreation-dependent systems, defined, among other things, by higher proportional employment in entertainment, accommodations, and food and beverage services. For both metro and nonmetro (think tourist hotspots like the San Francisco Bay Area and Yellowstone National Park, respectively) counties, the recreation economic typology has generally lower heart disease mortality rates (and smaller standard deviations) than other typologies, regardless of metro/nonmetro categorization. Is all work and no play related to more heart-related deaths?

This single closeup view at two predictors in vacuum produces more questions than answers, paving the way for further analysis. Whether one lives in a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan county, and the major economic force of the area have a combined effect on the heart disease mortality rate. What other variables, both within and outside of this dataset, could this apply to?
